# Master thesis

Code of my master thesis with the title "Combining bidirectional path tracing, Dynamic Diffuse Global Illumination and Reservoir-based Spatio-Temporal Importance Resampling to improve real time rendering quality" from 2023.
The software is based on Vulkan and SDL2.
It uses CMake for the build process and python for some additional tasks.
See test.sh for examples, how to start the program.
